# Progress

Single source of truth for build status. Update immediately after any phase work.

**Status legend:** `Not Started` · `In Progress` · `Done` (built, self-checked) · `Verified` (lint + type-check + build + phase acceptance criteria all pass)

## Verification checklist (per phase)

A phase moves to **Verified** only when all four pass:

- [ ] `npm run lint`
- [ ] `npm run type-check`
- [ ] `npm run build`
- [ ] Every acceptance criterion in the phase file

---

## Phase 0 — Repo & docs setup · Verified · 2026-07-30

**Built**

- Git repo initialized, pushed to `github.com/MyChat99/myaichat` (private, default branch `main`)
- `.gitignore` covering secrets (`.env`, `*.pem`, `*.key`), Node, Python, editor files, macOS
- Docs restructured to match the paths CLAUDE.md declares: `CLAUDE.md` at repo root, spec at `docs/00-PROJECT-SPEC.md`, the 8 phase files under `docs/phases/`
- Project wiki created at `docs/wiki/` (this file, ISSUES, DECISIONS, ROADMAP)
- `## Project wiki (mandatory)` section added to CLAUDE.md

**Verification**

- Structure confirmed against CLAUDE.md's stated layout — spec `@docs/00-PROJECT-SPEC.md` and `docs/phases/` references now resolve
- Lint / type-check / build: N/A — no application code or `package.json` yet

**Notes**

- No application code exists. Phase 1 starts from an empty scaffold.

---

## Phase 1 — Foundation · Done · 2026-07-30

Not yet **Verified** — one acceptance criterion is outstanding, see below.

**Built**

- Next.js 16.2.12 App Router, TypeScript strict, Tailwind v4, ESLint, Prettier, shadcn/ui (`base-nova`, CSS variables), Framer Motion, Lucide, Zod, sonner
- Directory layout per CLAUDE.md: `/app`, `/components`, `/lib/{db,security,providers,r2}`, `/emails`, `/scripts`, `/supabase`
- Four migrations covering all 9 spec tables, 2 enums, 9 indexes, `updated_at` triggers, RLS on every table, `is_admin()`, `handle_new_user()`, `providers_public`
- Three Supabase clients — browser, cookie-bound server, and a `server-only` admin client using the secret key
- Email/password auth: signup, login, signout, `/auth/confirm` for emailed links; session refresh in `proxy.ts`
- Protected `(app)` shell with header, chat placeholder, role-gated `/admin` placeholder
- `.env.example` covering every variable through Phase 8; idempotent seed script
- Three verification scripts committed as evidence: `verify:schema`, `verify:rls`, `verify:gates`

**Verification**

| Criterion | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run lint` | pass |
| `npm run type-check` | pass |
| `npm run build` | pass — 6 routes |
| Migrations apply cleanly | pass — 4 migrations pushed to the hosted project; `verify:schema` confirms all 9 tables, the view, and `is_admin()` |
| RLS: user A cannot query user B | pass — `verify:rls`, 23 checks |
| Non-admin visiting /admin is redirected | pass — `verify:gates`, 7 checks over real HTTP, incl. admin-reaches-`/admin` as a control |
| Sign up → login → authenticated shell | **outstanding** — not exercised through a browser |

**Deviations from the phase file**

- `supabase db reset` was not run. It is Docker-only locally, and `--linked` would destroy the hosted database. Migrations were validated with `db push` from zero instead, which covers the same ground on an empty project. See [ISSUE-004](ISSUES.md).
- `middleware.ts` is `proxy.ts` — Next 16 renamed the convention and warns on the old name.
- `lib/db/types.ts` is hand-written; `supabase gen types` needs Docker. See [ISSUE-005](ISSUES.md).
- Provider secrets use column-level grants rather than RLS, which cannot hide a column. See [DEC-005](DECISIONS.md).

**Bugs found and fixed during the phase**

- [ISSUE-007](ISSUES.md) — recursive `profiles` UPDATE policy (`42P17`) broke every profile edit. Fixed in migration `20260730120004`.

**To reach Verified**

1. Set `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env.local` and run `npm run seed`
2. Walk the browser flow once: sign up → confirm → login → shell → `/admin`
